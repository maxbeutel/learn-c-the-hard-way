This repository contains my attempts at solving the exercises from the e-book

Learn C the hard way - by Zed Shaw
http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

The code samples might not contian solutions to all exercises nor do I claim that they are a perfect solution.

I also differed on some ways from the original examples in the book, in so far as:

- using clang as compiler
- compile with warnings as errors, pedantic and warnings extra
- compile using c11 as standard

Work in progress.

Some code might be taken verbatim from the book and is therefore (c) by Zed Shaw where applicable.
